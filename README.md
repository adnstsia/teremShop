# teremShop

## Project Description

This project is a clothing store website that I developed during my internship at Terem Company. The website aims to provide users with a seamless shopping experience for a wide range of clothing items.

## Features

- **Custom Slider:** Implemented a custom slider feature for showcasing featured products or promotions on the homepage.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensured that the website is optimized for different devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms.
- **Pixel-Perfect Layout:** Paid close attention to detail in the design and implementation phase to achieve a pixel-perfect layout that meets design specifications.

## Technologies Used

1. **Event Handling**: The project utilizes event handling to respond to clicks on the "left" and "right" buttons, as well as on the images within the slider.
2. **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript is used to change the order of images displayed in the slider, achieved by modifying the style attribute of DOM elements.
3. **Array Methods**: Array methods such as `forEach`, `map`, `filter` are employed for convenient manipulation of images stored in an array.
4. **Conditional Statements**: The project includes conditional statements to check the number of images in the slider and to disable buttons if necessary.
5. **Adding and Removing CSS Classes**: JavaScript is used to add and remove CSS classes, dynamically changing the styles of elements on the page.
